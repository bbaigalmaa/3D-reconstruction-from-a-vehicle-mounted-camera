This thesis work has utilized **KITTI** Benchmark and **ELTECar** datasets. Those can be found from https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php and https://www.hackademix.hu/timeline-of-the-contest/

**KITTI** Benchmark has plenty of samples and implementaions. Those can be find in the tables of above mentioned site for KITTI. 
On the other hand, **ELTECar** dataset is set of images, GPS coordinates and Lidar points taken by vehicle mounted cameras used in Eötvös Loránd University, Faculty of Informatics.

Above picture shows ELTECar Camera setup, where this thesis work utilized DEV1 and DEV0 cameras. Each cameras measurements are relative to Lidar optical center, Y axis. The Cameras are monocular and HikVision/HikRobot MV-CA020-20GC model with normal optics. The cameras are placed around front wheel on the car, facing relative forward axis by 20 and 60 degree angles. Other than the cameras, ELTECar installed GPS, LIDAR, IMU. Those detailed current information can be found in https://www.hackademix.hu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sensor_pack_summary_2023.pdf. Generally, All the ELTECar datasets have same format and two different routes(for now). However, In case of simplicity, This elaboration is going to choose specific dataset and focus on explaining the procedure on the data. The specific dataset is second route captured on 2023.10.06. ELTECar Second Route 4th testing dataset - https://ikelte-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kovbando_inf_elte_hu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkovbando%5Finf%5Felte%5Fhu%2FDocuments%2Fosszerendelt%5Fnyers%5Fadatok%2F20231006&ga=1 - 22.1GB - referencing dataset as 20231006 due to it extracted into same named folder. Folder structure and ground truth generation steps are following.

The dataset contains following (see also 20231006/info.txt): 
<ul>
  <li>All image files - 20231006_ELTEkorV2_pictures.rar</li>
  <li>Raw lidar data - 20231006_ELTEkorV2_polars.rar</li>
  <li>Lidar scans in ‘xyz’ text format - 20231006_ELTEkorV2_cartesians.rar</li>
  <li>Route video - 20231006_ELTEkorV2.mp4</li>
  <li>Trajectory based on GPS sensor - 20231006_ELTEkorV2.kml</li>
  <li>GPS coordinates - 20231006_ELTEkorV2.csv</li>
</ul> 

Now, we need to prepare ground truth trajectory points from GPS. To do so, the steps are following in ELTECar Second Route 4th testing dataset:
<ol>
  <li>Extract ground truth source code - https://ikelte-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hajder_inf_elte_hu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fhajder%5Finf%5Felte%5Fhu%2FDocuments%2FBosch%2FBoschVerseny%20V3%2Fvisualize%5Fgroundtruth%5Fgps%5Fvectors%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fhajder%5Finf%5Felte%5Fhu%2FDocuments%2FBosch%2FBoschVerseny%20V3&ga=1</li>
  <li>As mentioned in the readme.txt, Create new folder named “images” and copy DEV0 images (20231006/20231006_ELTEkorV2_pictures/DEV0/Dev0_Image_w1920_h1200_fn*.jpg - in case of 4th second route testing data)</li>
  <li>Open command prompt in the folder and run “python ProcessGPSData.py 20231006/20231006_ELTEkorV2.csv” including the argument direction to .csv file of the dataset </li>
  <li>Above command (in step 3) generates 2 files and figure:
		<ul>
            <li>CorrectedGPSData.csv - GPS filtered data</li>
		    <li>pts2D.mat - vehicle 2D virtual trajectory</li>
		    <li>Figure displays 2D trajectory - can be saved for future reference of the figure </li> </ul>
  <li>An addition, velocity ground truth is able to be generated by running “python DrawSpeed.py 20231006/20231006_ELTEkorV2.csv video_with_speed.avi”. </li>
</ol> 

Then, to make simple to read images, ELTECar dataset has renamed to numerical ordering same as KITTI images. 
To do so, we need to execute ELTECarDatasetRename/rename_ELTECar.py with following parameters:
<ul>
<li> start - starting frame number (1, if it needs to be starting from first frame)</li>
    <li>last - last image frame number to be renamed </li>
    <li>path_read - image path which "Dev*_Image_w1920_h1200_fn*.jpg" exists</li>
    <li>path_write - path to write renamed images</li>
    <li>camera - specifiying which camera images are renaming with "DEV0" or "DEV1" or "DEV2" or "DEV3"</li>
</ul>
For example, in the 20231006 dataset we can run the following from opened command prompt in the folder, ELTECarDatasetRename. This inculdes general template and sample. <br>
TEMPLATE  -  "python rename_ELTECar.py start last path_read path_write camera" <br>
SAMPLE    -  "python rename_ELTECar.py 1 6145 PATH/FourthTestingDataForSecondRoute/20231006/20231006_ELTEkorV2_pictures/DEV0/ PATH/DEV0_renamed DEV0" <br>
